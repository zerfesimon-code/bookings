## Socket.IO Events and Workflows

This document lists all Socket.IO events in the system, who emits them, required auth, expected payloads, and what the server does and broadcasts in response.

### Conventions
- Auth: Driver or Passenger JWT is required as noted
- Rooms: Server joins sockets to logical rooms to scope broadcasts
- All broadcasting is handled via `events/` modules and `sockets/utils`

  - Emitter: Passenger
  - Auth: Passenger
  - Payload:
    - `vehicleType`: string (e.g., "mini")

      }
    }

---

### Driver Domain (Server Emits)

- Event: `booking:nearby`
  - Target: Driver socket on initial connection and on any reconnect
  - Notes:
    - Clients should subscribe to `booking:nearby` as soon as the socket connects and also re-subscribe on `connect` events after reconnects.
    - When sent immediately after a (re)connection, the payload includes `init: true` and contains a full snapshot of nearby unassigned bookings and any current bookings assigned to the driver.
    - Realtime incremental updates still arrive via `booking:new` and `booking:removed`; clients should merge these with the latest `booking:nearby` snapshot.
  - Payload:
    {
      init: true,
      driverId: "<ObjectId>",
      bookings: [
        {
          bookingId: "<ObjectId>",
          status: "requested|accepted|ongoing",
          pickup: any,
          dropoff: any,
          fare: number,
          passenger: {
            id: "<ObjectId>",
            name: string,
            phone: string
          }
        }
      ]
    }

  - Target: Room `booking:{bookingId}`
  - Payload: `{ bookingId, amount, distance, waitingTime, completedAt, driverEarnings, commission }`

### Driver Domain

- Event: `driver:availability`
  - Emitter: Driver
  - Auth: Driver
  - Payload: `{ available: boolean }`
  - Workflow:
    1) Update availability via `driverService.setAvailability`
    2) Emit to room `driver:{driverId}`: `driver:availability` { driverId, available }

- Event: `booking:driver_location_update`
  - Emitter: Driver
  - Auth: Driver
  - Payload: `{ latitude, longitude, bearing?, bookingId? }`
  - Workflow:
    1) Update last known location via `driverService.updateLocation`
    2) Broadcast `driver:location` and `driver:position` with latest coordinates via `driverEvents`
    3) Also emit driver-scoped channel `driver:location:{driverId}` with same payload
    4) If `bookingId` context is used, downstream services may persist to Live tracking (see Live domain) and emit booking-scoped updates
